# BACKGROUND
 Conduct a research project on individuals who were part of the company's workforce in the 1980s and 1990s. The only available data from that era is stored in six CSV files.
 
# OBJECTIVES
 Create tables to accommodate the data extracted from the CSV files, transfer the CSV files into a SQL database, and subsequently address inquiries related to the data. In other words, your  Tasks will involve: 
 
 Data Modeling
 
 Data Engineering
 
 Data Analysis
